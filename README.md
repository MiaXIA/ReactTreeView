## Build and Run Locally
use command in terminal

```
cd /the path where this folder is
npm install
npm start
```
Then it will run at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage
It can be used with other project by simply included RCTree.js file and provide the variable to render as the `data` property (also don't forget install rc-tree package and check the css file import path).

```JavaScript
import RCTree from "/path to RCTRee.js";

let data = [
    {
      name: 'Mia/Folder1/Note1',
      description: 'You are inside Mia/Folder1/Note1',
      id: 'id-Mia/Folder1/Note1'
    },
    {
      name: 'Mia/Folder1/Note2',
      description: 'You are inside Mia/Folder1/Note2',
      id: 'id-Mia/Folder1/Note2'
    },
    {
      name: 'Mia',
      description: 'You are inside Mia',
      id: 'id-Mia'
    },
    {
      name: 'Mia/ProjectWork/Note1',
      description: 'You are inside Mia/ProjectWork/Note1',
      id: 'id-Mia/ProjectWork/Note1'
    },
    {
      name: 'Mia/ProjectWork/Note2',
      description: 'You are inside Mia/ProjectWork/Note2',
      id: 'id-Mia/ProjectWork/Note2'
    }
  ];

 <RCTree data={data} />
 ```
