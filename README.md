## Build and Run Locally
use command in terminal

```
cd /the path where this folder is
npm install
npm start
```
Then it will run at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

It can be used with other project by simply included RCTree.js file and provide the variable to render as the `data` property (also don't forget install rc-tree package and check the css file import path).
